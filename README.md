### Built With

* Laravel 7.21.0
* PHP 7.4
* MySQL 8
* JavaScript & jQuery
* Bootstrap 3.3.5
* HTML5, CSS3



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* You will need a Local Server to execute the PHP files (like XAMPP, MAMP).
* npm
* composer

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo directly under the public / htdocs folder of your Local Server (otherwise, the Maps API wonÂ´t work).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bassmastaLK/srpago-test.git
```
2. Install NPM packages.
```sh
npm install
```
3. Install Composer packages.
```sh
composer install
```
4. Allow the application to connect to your local databases:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1 Create a new database in your local database manager (phpMyAdmin / Sequel Pro / TablePlus).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 Under the repo root directory, duplicate the <i>.env.example</i> file and name it <i>.env</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 Change this new file's DB_DATABASE value to match your new database's name (line 12).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4 If necessary, also edit the other database connection values, like username or password (lines 9 to 14).<br>

5. Generate an application encryption key.
```sh
php artisan key:generate
```
6. Run a Laravel migration to create and populate the required tables.
```sh
php artisan migrate
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If the previous steps didn't throw any error, start your server's Apache and MySQL services and the application should be working at [http://localhost/srpago-test/public/](http://localhost/srpago-test/public/).

In case of problems with the Migration / databases configuration, the dump files for manual import can be found [here](https://github.com/bassmastaLK/srpago-test/blob/master/public/db).

If the difficulties persist and local setup can't be done, the application is also available in my personal domain: [http://marruffomultimedia.com/srpago](http://marruffomultimedia.com/srpago).
